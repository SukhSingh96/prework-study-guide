# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This project consists of a webpage with different coding languages that are working in tandem to display the contents of the webpage. My motivation towards creating this is to learn the basics of coding so I can succeed in my new career path. This webpage allowed me to practice and hone my coding skills and it did a great job at that. I feel more confident moving forward with this bootcamp because of this training lesson. I have learned to modify a webpage using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
